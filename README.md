# Record Linkage Application
## Created by: Joe and Dorcas

This is a record linkage application developed in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Streamlit. The application is designed to perform record linkage tasks, which involve identifying and linking records that refer to the same entity across different data sources.
## Methods
This method uses a Siamese network as well as LSH with a random matrix

- **Graphical User Interface**: The application features an intuitive GUI built with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the record linkage functionality using a web browser.
  
- **Record Linkage Algorithms**: The application includes various record linkage algorithms and methods for comparing and matching records, such as exact matching and Machine Learning model

- **Data Import and Export**: The application supports importing data from CSV file formats and exporting linked records to facilitate further analysis and integration with other systems.

## Installation

The application is web-based. As such, there is no need for installation. **Click** (https://inspireaphrc-01.streamlit.app/) 

## Additional.

- **The Notebook**: The Jupyternotebook illustrates the project's development, the machine learning model's development, and other excellent visuals.
